# MTGInventory
A simple and small Web Platform which is going to list all MTG (Magic: The Gathering) cards we own.
For this we wanted to learn Django and saw our little project as an oppurtunity to begin.

## Who are we?
We are Ferhat and Sedat Saritas, two young developers and fans of this great game called Magic: The Gathering.

## Tech Stack
- Python3.6+
- Django2.2.10
- SQLite3
- Bootstrap4
